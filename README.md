# Research and planning:

First step in any task is research and planning and I took my time in trying to understand the task as good as possible. Under normal circumstances, in a team, I would ask my team mates for opinions.

Using Postman, I made a few queries to the end-points indicated, to try to understand what is the structure of the data response. From that, I got quite a good idea for what I would have to do next.

I implemented some data handling like adding and deleting people to a list. Add meetings to a calendar, get information about upcoming meetings and the names of atendees. I could go further but that would require more end-points on the API server.

## Design and branding:

A products strength is composed in equal parts of good code and good design.
To be able to do a design, I took the freedom of imagining a brand for the company. I chose colors and I designed a simple but sharp logo and favicon. The process of thinking and designing an interface from scratch took more time than the programming but I really believe that a client would be more impressed by a good design that does little than a bad design that does a lot.

## Programming:

I used React.js, HTML5 and CSS3. For CSS3 I could have used SASS but I feel like the compiled CSS is sometimes messier than a well thought CSS and since I can use CSS3 variables, SASS was simply unnecesary.

## Usage:

Extract the archive.

build folder contains a built version of the app.
src folder contains the "uncompiled" source code.
**npm install** to install dependencies
**npm start** to start the dev server
**npm build** to compile the source
